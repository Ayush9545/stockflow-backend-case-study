# Bynry Backend Case Study – StockFlow

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the Backend Engineering Intern case study at Bynry Inc.  
The case study focuses on backend fundamentals such as code review, database design, and API development for a simple B2B inventory management system (StockFlow).

I intentionally focused on clarity, correctness, and explaining my thought process rather than building a fully production-ready system, as the requirements were intentionally incomplete.

## Case Study Document
All responses to Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 are documented directly in this repository as code and comments.

The focus was on:
- Explaining what was wrong in the given code
- Why it could fail in production
- What changes I made and why
- What assumptions I made due to missing requirements
